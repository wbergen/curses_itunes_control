## iTunes Control via Applescript w/ Bash, Python

### Screen:
![alt text](https://m7c1.com/resources/tunes_control.png "Tunes Control OS X")

### Notes:
* This is a very simple python script, which calls tiny bash progs
* It could be easily written as all bash, or at least without all the files, but I sometimes want to call the individual actions, or use them in other scripts.
